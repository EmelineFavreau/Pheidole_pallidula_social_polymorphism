I investigate the differences between social type (monogynous, polygynous) for raw read coverage.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8)
```



```{r import files and load libraries, include = FALSE}
# import raw sequence coverage
raw_sequence_coverage <- read.csv("115_pheidole_coverage.txt", header = FALSE, sep = 
"\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# import metadata
metadata_df <- read.csv("../data/S2_pheidole_pop_paper.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# get and/or load all the libraries
basic_libraries <- c("ggplot2", "tidyr")
for (lib in basic_libraries) {
        if (require(package = lib, character.only = TRUE)) {
                print("Successful")
        } else {
                print("Installing")
                install.packages(lib)
                library(lib, character.only = TRUE )
        }
}
```

## Sample coverage by the raw reads

Here I investigate if there is a difference of coverage by raw sequences between samples of monogynous origin and polygynous origin.




```{r raw sequences coverage, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Step 1: tidy input dataframe
# name columns
colnames(raw_sequence_coverage) <- c("sample_name", "sequence_count")

# update name of samples 
# I27-P, A56-M, andrea-P, muna-P
raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name <- gsub(pattern = "I27\\-N.*",    x = raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name, replacement = "I27-P_R1_001")
raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name <- gsub(pattern = "A56\\-N.*",    x = raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name, replacement = "A56-M_R1_001")
raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name <- gsub(pattern = "andrea\\-N.*", x = raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name, replacement = "andrea-P_R1_001")
raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name <- gsub(pattern = "muna\\-N.*",   x = raw_sequence_coverage$sample_name, replacement = "muna-P_R1_001")

# tidy the dataframe: the sequence count in second line equals the sequence count in first line
for(position in seq(1, nrow(raw_sequence_coverage)-1, by = 2)){
  # update the sequence count
  raw_sequence_coverage[position, 2] <- raw_sequence_coverage[position+1, 2]
}
# remove the lines with "Total Sequences""
raw_sequence_coverage_cleaned <- subset(raw_sequence_coverage, subset = sample_name != "Total Sequences")






## Step 2: extract information for each sample 

# make vector of colony names
colony_name_vec <- unique(gsub(pattern = "\\_R.*", x = raw_sequence_coverage_cleaned$sample_name, replacement = ""))
# make dataframe to gather information for each sample
sequence_coverage_per_social <- as.data.frame(matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = length(colony_name_vec)))
# name the columns
colnames(sequence_coverage_per_social) <- c("sample_name", "total_sequence_count", "social")
# add the colony names
sequence_coverage_per_social$sample_name <- colony_name_vec
# add the social type (M or P)
sequence_coverage_per_social$social <- gsub(pattern = ".*\\-", x = sequence_coverage_per_social$sample_name, replacement = "")

# looping through one sample at a time
for(position in 1:length(colony_name_vec)){
  # subset the raw df for this sample
  # add the sum of sequence count for R1 and R2
  sequence_coverage_per_social$total_sequence_count[sequence_coverage_per_social$sample_name == colony_name_vec[position]] <- sum(raw_sequence_coverage_cleaned$s
equence_count[grep(pattern = colony_name_vec[position], x = raw_sequence_coverage_cleaned$sample_name)])
}

## Step 3: Are those distributions statistically different?
# test of the equality of continuous probability distribution used to compare the two social groups
# run a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
# a.k.a testing the shape of the distribution
# The null hypothesis is that both groups were sampled from populations with identical distributions
total_sequence_countM <- sequence_coverage_per_social$total_sequence_count[sequence_coverage_per_social$social== "M"]
total_sequence_countP <- sequence_coverage_per_social$total_sequence_count[sequence_coverage_per_social$social== "P"]
#ks.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value
# 0.005581148 < 0.05, significant, the two distributions shapes are different
#print(paste("KS test p =", ks.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value))
# test of the null hypothesis that it is equally likely that a randomly selected value from one sample will be less than or greater than a randomly selected value from a second sample
# run a Mannâ€“Whitney U test (wilcoxon) test
# testing if the medians are different (non-paramteric ttest)
#wilcox.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value
# 0.01008714 < 0.05, significant, the two distributions median are from different distributions



# the outlier E115 (purple peak on the right) might affect the tests
# # removing the outlier "E15-P" and running the test again
# sequence_coverage_per_social_NoOutlier <- subset(sequence_coverage_per_social, subset = sample_name != "E15-P")
# total_sequence_countM <- sequence_coverage_per_social_NoOutlier$total_sequence_count[sequence_coverage_per_social_NoOutlier$social== "M"]
# total_sequence_countP <- sequence_coverage_per_social_NoOutlier$total_sequence_count[sequence_coverage_per_social_NoOutlier$social== "P"]
# ks.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value
# # 0.00413318 < 0.05, significant, the two distributions shapes are different
# wilcox.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value
# # 0.006575152 < 0.05, significant, the two distributions median are from different distributions


## Step 4: plot the results
plot_title    <- "Read coverage distribution by social type"
plot_subtitle <- "Data from FastQC count of Total Sequences"
x_title       <- "Sequence count"
annotation_text <- paste("KS test p =", round(ks.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value, digits = 5),
                         "\nWilcoxon test p =", round(wilcox.test(x = total_sequence_countM, y = total_sequence_countP)$p.value, digits = 5))
ggplot(sequence_coverage_per_social, aes(x = total_sequence_count, fill = social, colour = social)) +
   geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
   labs(title = plot_title, subtitle = plot_subtitle, x = x_title) +
   # Monogynous orange f, Polygynous purple 9
   scale_fill_manual(values   = c("#f1a340", "#998ec3")) +
   scale_colour_manual(values = c("#f1a340", "#998ec3")) +
   theme_classic() +
   annotate("text", x = 50000000, y = 0.00000007, label = annotation_text)
```
